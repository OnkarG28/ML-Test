House Price Prediction using KNN Regression
Overview
This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression algorithm to predict house prices based on various features. KNN Regression is a non-parametric algorithm that predicts the target value by averaging the values of its k nearest neighbors. This README provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, methodology, and instructions for running the code.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

To predict house prices accurately using the KNN Regression algorithm.
To evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
To provide insights into the factors influencing house prices through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Data Collection: Obtain the dataset containing information about house features and prices.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and gain insights into relationships between variables.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features that significantly impact house prices.
Model Training: Train the KNN Regression model using the selected features and target variable (house prices).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as r2 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or test dataset.
